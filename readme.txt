THEME: ONE ROOM
===============
TITLE: SNAPPED

Wanted to work on something very graphics / media intensive...

Idea: Mix between Under a Killing Moon and Fight Club...
 You start as an investigator working the case of a missing family. You spawn in a one bedroom apartment with no windows and have to investigate for clues around the apartment. The place is old and dirty, but the clues should indicate you that there were 3 people living here: a couple and their child. Clues indicate also that things were not going well and that the woman was about to leave with the child. Also the guy seems to be going crazy, hearing voices and seeing things. You see pills on the floor (LSD?), and other items... After a while, things suddenly change:

The lights go out, and you use a lamp torch to see what's going on, but a lot of items have changed: blood inscriptions on the wall, blood on the floor, etc. As an investigator, you start thinking that you are crazy, or that the voices that the man was hearing actually are real. Then loud bangs on the entrance door, and as you go there and turn around, you suddenly see the woman and child dead, realize that you were the one going crazy, and the police crashes the door behind you as we do an outro...

PROPS:
- a small apartment filled with 3d props to make it feel used and old. I'll need to take a bunch of pictures and work around textures in photoshop, alongside with models in Blender.
- some music for each mood, jazz-style improv for the UAKM part, and stressful for the second part... Perhaps the Fight club music in the end.
- not a whole lot of programming... Just actionable items to visualize clues.
- a lot of voice acting, probably also sound effects.

Apartment 6mx7m (42m2) + bathroom
Time to go take some pictures for the textures!!

2 AM.... As I thought, the assets are taking a super long time to build...
Time to call it a night... I should get the kitchen done soon and start on the mechanics of basic animation / discovery

Then I need to make the desk, the TV + stand, the bathroom, the bathroom sink and the bathtube (6 big models!)
I will start working on some music right after that to pause from blender
Then it'll all be about building the phase 1 where we have clues around, aka more models but much smaller.
And hopefully I can get to start phase 2, with the mood shift and the new textures for the walls...
Sound effects will play a huge part so I need to dedicate some time to that as well..
