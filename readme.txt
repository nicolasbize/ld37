THEME: ONE ROOM
===============
TITLE: SNAPPED

Wanted to work on something very graphics / media intensive...

Idea: Mix between Under a Killing Moon and Fight Club...
 You start as an investigator working the case of a missing family. You spawn in a one bedroom apartment with no windows and have to investigate for clues around the apartment. The place is old and dirty, but the clues should indicate you that there were 3 people living here: a couple and their child. Clues indicate also that things were not going well and that the woman was about to leave with the child. Also the guy seems to be going crazy, hearing voices and seeing things. You see pills on the floor (LSD?), and other items... After a while, things suddenly change:

The lights go out, and you use a lamp torch to see what's going on, but a lot of items have changed: blood inscriptions on the wall, blood on the floor, etc. As an investigator, you start thinking that you are crazy, or that the voices that the man was hearing actually are real. Then loud bangs on the entrance door, and as you go there and turn around, you suddenly see the woman and child dead, realize that you were the one going crazy, and the police crashes the door behind you as we do an outro...

PROPS:
- a small apartment filled with 3d props to make it feel used and old. I'll need to take a bunch of pictures and work around textures in photoshop, alongside with models in Blender.
- some music for each mood, jazz-style improv for the UAKM part, and stressful for the second part... Perhaps the Fight club music in the end.
- not a whole lot of programming... Just actionable items to visualize clues.
- a lot of voice acting, probably also sound effects.

the pipes, the 2 dead hung bodies, a bunch of props

OK TIME TO PAUSE BLENDER... Let's go ahead and work on the music for the game

So we'll need 4 music:
- one for the intro (slow blues improv)
- one for the stage 1 (slow jazz improv)
- one stressful for stage 2 (we'll mixup some stuff here)
- one for the credits (cover from the trial - pink floyd during the chorus "Craaazy..")

GarageBand here we go!!
